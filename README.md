# GeoHealth

The ability to provide wide scale public health information catered to usersâ€™ local area improves community health efforts and elevates business outreach. Users will interact with their local community health resources through public health information or business profiles and directions. The system will forward those contacts to the business to help them be more seen. In turn, businesses will provide customer services through the software as needed.
